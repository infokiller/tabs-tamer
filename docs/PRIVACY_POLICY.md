# Privacy policy

This document describes the privacy policy that applies to all information collected or submitted when you install or use the Tabs Tamer extension (referred to herein as "the extension"). The extension is an [open source](https://github.com/infokiller/tabs-tamer) extension for multiple web browsers, owned and operated by the open source community.

## Collection of information

The extension reads the website URL and your keyboard input at any website for which the extension is enabled, in order to do what it is supposed to do. It does not store any of this data, neither locally on your computer or on a remote server. The extension also does not use cookies or collect any other kind of information by any other means.

## Service providers

The extension provides the ability to change user preferences. User preferences are stored locally and may be stored on a remote server ("cloud"), both depending on your web browser and its settings. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of your web browser and its (cloud) storage of user preferences. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of your web browser. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Links to third party websites

Our extension may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of these websites. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
